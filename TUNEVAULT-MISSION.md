# TuneVault - Mission & Goals

## Mission Statement
**"To become the most comprehensive, free-to-use resource for old time musicians — a one-stop library for tunes, AUDIO, transcriptions, and community."**

---

## Why TuneVault Exists

1. **Problem:** Old time fiddle tunes are scattered across dozens of websites, forums, and PDFs. No single place has everything.

2. **Solution:** Aggregate tunes from all sources into ONE searchable database.

3. **Value:** 
   - Musicians spend less time hunting for tunes
   - More tunes = more useful = more traffic
   - Free tier builds audience → premium features = income

### Premium Tier (FUTURE)
